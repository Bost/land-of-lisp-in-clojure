# Land of Lisp in Clojure

As I did with [The Little Schemer](https://github.com/midpeter444/little-schemer) and [The Seasoned Schemer](https://github.com/midpeter444/little-schemer/tree/master/clojure/seasoned-schemer), I read along Conrad Barski's [Land of Lisp](http://landoflisp.com/) by doing all the exercises in Clojure.  My Clojure skills are much stronger than they were when I did the Schemer books, so I hope the Clojure code is more idiomatic.

In many cases, I did not literally follow Barski's Lisp code, but rather used the data structure most appropriate and idiomatic to Clojure.

## Status

So far I have read through Ch. 14.  So the webserver code and all previous chapters are done.  I am in the middle of doing Ch. 15 - Dice of Doom version 1.
