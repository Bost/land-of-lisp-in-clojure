# Land of Lisp in Clojure

As I did with the Little Schemer and the Seasoned Schemer, I read along Conrad Barski's Land of Lisp by doing all the exercises in Clojure.  My Clojure skills are much stronger than they were when I did the Schemer books, so I hope they are more idiomatic.

In many cases, I did not literally follow Barski's Lisp code, but rather used the data structure most appropriate and idiomatic to Clojure.

## Status

So far I have read through Ch. 14.  So the webserver code and all previous chapters are done.  I am in the middle of doing Ch. 15 - Dice of Doom version 1.
